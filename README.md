# Web Scraping: Tweet Archive of Twitter User [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) data analysis

The project includes the following contents:  
* Introduction
* Presentation of our Data Analysis process(in the .ipynb file known as Wrangle_act), which involved the following phases. 
    * Data gathering   
    * Data assessing  
    * Data Cleaning  
    * Data Analysis and visualization
* A wrangle report(wrangle_report), explaining how the dataset was gotten, handled and the procedure for analysis 
* An act_report which communicates our findings from the data and presents their respective visualisations
* Data sets used (gathered from three sources, including downloading file from Udacity, dowloading from url and web scraping from Twitter API)
  

### Language, Packages and Libraries  
The project is using Jupyter notebook with Python 3.7. The packages include numpy, pandas, requests, tweepy, json, timeit, re, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, and scipy.stats.

### Metadata
The definition of tweet data can be found on the [twitter website](  https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/data-dictionary/overview/tweet-object.html)  

Image prediction is generated by neural network. The definitions of the variables are in the following table.

| Variable Name  | Definition                                                                                  |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| tweet_id       | the last part of the tweet URL after "status/"                                              |
| p1             | the algorithm's #1 prediction for the image in the tweet                                    |
| p1_conf        | how confident the algorithm is in its #1 prediction                                         |
| p1_dog         | whether or not the #1 prediction is a breed of dog                                          |
| p2             | the algorithm's #2 prediction for the image in the tweet                                    |
| p2_conf        | how confident the algorithm is in its #2 prediction                                         |
| p2_dog         | whether or not the #2 prediction is a breed of dog                                          |
| p3             | the algorithm's #3 prediction for the image in the tweet                                    |
| p3_conf        | how confident the algorithm is in its #3 prediction                                         |
| p3_dog         | whether or not the #3 prediction is a breed of dog                                          |
